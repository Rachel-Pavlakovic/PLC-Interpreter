# PLC-Interpreter

This is a semester long project for EECS345 at Case Western Reserve University.
The interpreter was written in four parts:
  - Part 1: while loops and if statements with single lines of code, variable declaration and assignment, return
  - Part 2: allow blocks of code, implemented try/catch/finally/ and break, continue, throw
  - Part 3: added functions
  - Part 4: added classes
